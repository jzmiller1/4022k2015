SRID # 97456
used UTM-8

Used ArcMAP to narrow down the US County shapefiles to GA county shapefiles for 2000 and 2010
I used the shapefile loader to easily load the shapefiles into postgreSQL9.3

We tried to find the dissolve function in PostgreSQL9.3 and were unsuccessful so we 
used ArcMAP to dissolve the circuits and districts and then imported these 2 shapefiles into our database
